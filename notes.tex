Learning Goals
1. Practice writing functions
2. Explain calling functions from within other functions
3. Practice basics of control flow and return statements

# Deliverables:

1. Write a function named distanceFromHqInBlocks

    [] - receives input (p/u location)
    [] - returns (number of blocks from Scuber HQ (42nd Street))

2. Write a function named distanceFromHqInFeet
    [] - takes return value from first function (start and destination blocks)
       and uses it to create creates another function 
       (distanceTravelledInFeet)
    [] - returns number of feet travelled
        - each block in Manhattan = 264 feet
  
3. Write a function named distanceFromHqInFeet
    [] - takes start and destination blocks    
    [] - returns number of feet travelled
       
    example data: (34, 38) 
    example equation: (38-34)*264   

4. Write function called calculatesFarePrice
    [] - function looks like,
        calculatesFarePrice(start, destination) {
            //returns ride fare
       }
    [] - given the same start/destination arguments from previous test
    [] - returns customer fare;
        first 400ft = 'free'
        between 400(>=401)-800ft = 2 cent/ft (minus 400ft from total distance)
